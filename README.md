# 📘 Description

**कर्तव्यं परमं तपः**  

KartavyaFEED is a purpose-driven SaaS platform designed to empower UPSC aspirants with curated news and category-specific insights.  
It helps students navigate current affairs with clarity, confidence, and a sense of duty.

> “Duty is the highest form of discipline.” 

<br />

# 🌠 Vision

KartavyaFEED is more than a platform—it is a quiet revolution in how aspirants prepare, reflect, and serve.

Rooted in the ethos of UPSC and the spirit of kartavya (duty), it aims to:

- **Empower aspirants** with clarity, not clutter.
- **Bridge technology and purpose**, using AI to deepen—not distract—preparation.
- **Cultivate ethical leadership**, where knowledge is guided by humility and service.
- **Offer companionship**, not just content—through tools that think, reflect, and evolve with the user.
- **Build a legacy**, where every insight contributes to a more thoughtful Bharat.

KartavyaFEED envisions a future where preparation is not a race, but a ritual.  
Where every headline becomes a lesson, and every lesson becomes a step toward service.

> “Let knowledge be the lamp and kartavya be the path.”
